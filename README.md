Welcome to **HandDrive**, a Python based computer vision project that lets you control the car in **Hill Climb Racing** using hand gestures. No keyboard, no joystick — just your palm! 🖐️

## 🧠 Features

- 🖐️ Real-time hand gesture detection using MediaPipe
- 🚗 Controls for **start** (open hand) and **stop** (closed fist)
- 🕹️ Game automation for Hill Climb Racing (or similar 2D driving games)
- ⚡ Lightweight & easy to set up

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- 🐍 Python 3
- 🤖 [MediaPipe](https://github.com/google/mediapipe) for hand tracking
- 🖥️ OpenCV for video processing
- 🎮 `pyautogui` for simulating key presses

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Open Hand** – All fingers up → Presses the **gas** key.
2. **Closed Fist** – All fingers down → Releases the gas key.
3. Game reacts just like you’re pressing the key yourself!
